scrapeUCLA
==========

until there's a neat DB for UCLA stuffs, we'll have to scrape

## From the creators of UCLA's ClassScanner
We basically parsed the UCLA pages using a PHP library called Simple HTML Dom (http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) to get class information, and stored the results into our database.

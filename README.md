scrapeUCLA
==========

until there's a neat API for UCLA stuffs, we'll have to scrape

## a note from the creators of UCLA's ClassScanner:
"We basically parsed the UCLA pages using a PHP library called [Simple HTML DOM](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) to get class information, and stored the results into our database."
